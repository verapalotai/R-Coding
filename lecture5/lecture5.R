# Script for lecture 5

<<<<<<< HEAD
#Today: group_by(), summarise()
# Next week: read_*, parse_*, spread(), gather(), tidy the data
=======
# Team 4
# PÃ©ter
# Alexandra
# Kristof
# Miklos

# Points:
# 1. Don't list all functions, e.g. geoms
# 2. Exam in DA1
# 3. Look at file before submitting
# 4. ggsave
# 5. using vienna code and theming
# 6. Team: How to assign/report exercises
# 7. After week 6, change of time (17:30-19:00), same room

# Today: group_by(), summarise()
# Next week(s): read_*, parse_*, spread() and gather() tidy the data
