# Plot Brownian Motions (BMs)

  # TODO: Refactor, I keep typing the same parameters again and again. 
  all_steps <- sign(runif(N, min = -0.5, max = 0.5))
  all_xs <- cumsum(all_steps)
  df <- tibble(time = 1:N, position = all_xs)

    geom_line()
}

plot_BM(25)
plot_BM(250)

# But... what if we want to use the data of these BMs? We now only have the plot.
# Bad design of the function. 
# A function should (ideally) do one thing.

get_steps <- function(n) {
  sample(c(-1,1), N, replace = TRUE)
}

get_BM <- function(N) {
  #all_steps <- sign(runif(N, min = -0.5, max = 0.5))
  all_xs <- cumsum(get_steps(N))
  return(all_xs) # Not necessary, as default is to return last thing
}

plot_BM <- function(bm) {
  df <- tibble(time = 1:length(bm), position = bm)
  ggplot(df, aes(x = time, y = position)) +
    geom_line()
}

# We can do as before:
plot_BM(get_BM(500))

# But we can also first get the BM if we need it:
bm1 <- get_BM(500)
plot_BM(bm1)

# What if we want to plot multiple BMs? See Appendix to these lecture notes

## Plot the histogram of results for where a BM is after 500 steps. 
res <- replicate(n = 1000, expr = get_BM(500)[500])
hist(res) # Good for quick and dirty, not good for publication and reports.

## Plot the histogram at the 400th iteration
res <- replicate(n = 1000, expr = get_BM(500)[400])
hist(res)

# But it makes more sense to compute the BMs once, then get differnt positions.
bms <- replicate(n = 1000, expr = get_BM(500))
head(bms)

# Can you tell whether a single BM is in a row or in a column?
# It is in a column. So the Nth row (the first number) gives the Nth observation
# for every BM.
hist(bms[400,])

# Another example: simulating dice rolls

## roll 3 dices! 1-6 x 3
sample(1:6, 3, replace = TRUE)

## TODO roll 3 dices 1K times and plot the sum of points
set.seed(42)
dices <- function() {sample(1:6, 3, replace = TRUE)}
dices_sum <- function() {sum(dices())}
dices_sum()
hist(replicate(1000, dices_sum()))
## NOTE shouldn't this be symmetric?

df <- tibble(x = replicate(1e5, dices_sum()))
ggplot(df, aes(x = x))  + 
  geom_histogram()
ggplot(df, aes(x = x))  + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 16)
ggplot(df, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_bar()
# Lesson: Use bar charts for discrete data, histogram for continuous
# In base R:
hist(replicate(100000, dices_sum()))
hist(replicate(1e5, dices_sum()))
hist(replicate(1e5, dices_sum()), breaks = 2:18)
table(replicate(1e5, dices_sum()))
barplot(table(replicate(1e5, dices_sum())))

# Appendix

# OPTIONAL: For the curious, if you plan on writing functions with ggplot.
# I'll skip it, since there is some rather esoteric stuff going on
# to get it working. Namely, see the use of aes_ (note the underscore).
# There is a tidy way (meaning to use the tidyverse way of thinking) to do it too.
# Our plotting function is a little too specific
# Let's pass in a list of BMs, and make sure to say what time to plot

# Read this in your own time if you want to know why you should *not*
# use for loops with ggplot.

# The bug is somewhat subtle.
# See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26235825/for-loop-only-adds-the-final-ggplot-layer
# Lesson: Do *not* put ggplot in a for loop if you want multiple graphs on the same plot.
# Use ggplot functionality to create multiple plots directly (i.e. pass a dataframe with all the
# data, and group correctly).
# Bugs will ensue.
